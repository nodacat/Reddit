#   this sets the number of teams you'd like to return, and evenly distributes the number of people into that group
#   you can tweak these numbers to say split 6 people into 2 groups of 3 or 3 groups of 2 by changing the number in the 6th index, for example
#   if people cant be distributed evenly in each groups, 'dummy' people are created to help balance (then removed later)
